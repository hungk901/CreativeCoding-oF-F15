#Project 01

##Let's make a beautiful tree!
-----
* ####Concept
For this project, I am creating a tree that has different looks based on the seasons. In spring, there are some but not many leaves and some flowers; In summer, there are more and more leaves and fruits will also grow up; In fall, leaves drop and there will not be any flowers and fruits; In winter, there is nothing on the tree but branches.

* ####What I learn from this project
This is my first time doing a project by using openFrameworks, except previous assignements. After the process, I understand how to draw objects by using classes, how class structures work, how recursive run, etc. Basically, openFrameworks is cool because it can visualize things, almost everything in my mind. Visualization amazed me all the time!

* ####Challenge I faced
Sometimes I messed up the position things of objects before I understand how to manipulate ofPushstyle, ofPopstyle, ofPushMatrix and ofPopMatrix. Hopefully, I got familiar with these functions gradually and solved the problems.
