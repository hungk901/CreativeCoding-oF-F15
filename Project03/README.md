##Move the World - Project using Leap Motion

-----
* ####Concept
I am creating another particle system to mess with for this project. The particle system can be move by mouse, and if the mouse is steady, particles will form a dynamic pattern themselves. However, instead of always using mouse to trigger actions, I would like to use external devices to do cooler things. Initiallty, I did not know which device is good for me. After talking to Regina, TA of my openFrameworks class, she suggested me to use Leap Motion.

	`Regina lent her Leap Motion to me! She is so kind!!! Thank you Regina!`

* ####What I learn from this project
I learn how to make a new particle system with different movement. Also I learn how to use Leap Motion and its addons. 

* ####Challenge I faced
Dynamic particles are hard to handle and sometimes losed control. If I do not set the parameters in the accurate range, the particles will in a mess. So I spent plenty of time to understand the rules and regular patterns.

####How to Control this app:
	1. Connect your Leap Motion;
	2. On your computer, launch Leap Motion app and switch to Visualiztion Mode;
	3. Use your hand to mess with the paritcles!
