##Move the World - Project using Leap Motion

-----
* ####Concept
I am creating another particle system to mess with for this project. The particle system can be move by mouse, and if the mouse is steady, particles will form a dynamic pattern themselves. However, instead of always using mouse to trigger actions, I would like to use external devices to do cooler things. Initiallty, I did not know which device is good for me. After talking to Regina, TA of my openFrameworks class, she suggested me to use Leap Motion.

	`Regina lent her Leap Motion to me! She is so kind!!! Thank you Regina!`

* ####What I learn from this project
I learn how to make a new particle system with different movement. Also I learn how to use Leap Motion and its addons. Leap Motion addon has great examples so it did not take a lot of time to figure how to manipulate the parameters and functions. 

* ####Challenge I faced
The center of coordinate plane used to start at upper left corner in openFrameworks, but. the examples of Leap Motion change the coordinates plane and put the (0,0) in the center of window. So I spent some time to make (0,0) back to upper left. Moreover, I rescaled the width and height from examples and transformed to default setting.

####How to Control this app:
	1. Connect your Leap Motion;
	2. On your computer, launch Leap Motion app and switch to Visualiztion Mode;
	3. Use your hand to mess with the paritcles!
	4. Need some hints? Try to make a fist and release!
