#Project 1-Inspiration

###The first idea came up wtih in my mind is "**Lightning**".

Lightning is one of my favorite natural phenomenon. Lightning happens suddenly. Its beautiful structure disappears so fast that it is too hard to record if you are not prepared. And it never strikes twice in the same place and never be the same. Sometimes it is blue, sometimes it is purple and sometime it is white. 

Lightinings are always different and happen in a second so that is why lightning attracts me so much. And this is also why I want to build my lightning in this project.
